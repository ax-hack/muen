--D The Crash Audit facility records information in case an unrecoverable error
--D occurs during runtime. Several crash audit records can be allocated to
--D handle the case where multiple CPUs encounter a crash at the same instant.
--D The information is written to an uncached memory region which can be
--D evaluated after rebooting the system. Examination of the audit information
--D should be powerful enough to determine the cause of the crash.
